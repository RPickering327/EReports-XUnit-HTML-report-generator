# EReports-XUnit-HTML-report-generator
A custom built XUnit 2.0 report generator which uses the XML generated by Xunit test runner to make a nice and simple HTML report to display the test results for selenium and unit based tests.

How to use:

Via visual studio:
1. Download the project to your desktop.
2. Open the project in visual studio or an IDE capable of openning a C# console application.
3. Open the program.cs file.
4. Edit the following two variables. XML report location is generated by using:
```dotnet test --test-adapter-path:. --logger:xunit``` with the xunit console logger installed.

   ``` var XmlReportLocation = "Location of the XUnit generated XML";```
   
    ```var SaveLocation = "Destination to save the report.";```
    
5. Open the report.
